GPTRPG

An experiment with using GPT3 to generate content for Dungeons & Dragons, 5th Edition

Goals:
- Build a 'fine-tuned' GPT3 model and supporting Python functions which can produce novel, mechanically viable monsters on demand.
- Build API to connect with the model and a front-end to allow for easy user interface.
